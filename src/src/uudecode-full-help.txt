uudecode (GNU sharutils) - decode an encoded file - Ver. 4.13.3
USAGE:  uudecode [ -<flag> [<val>] | --<name>[{=| }<val>] ]... [ file ... ]

   -o, --output-file=str      direct output to file
   -c, --ignore-chmod         Ignore fchmod(3P) errors
   -v, --version[=arg]        Output version information and exit
   -h, --help                 Display extended usage information and exit
   -!, --more-help            Extended usage information passed thru pager
   -R, --save-opts[=arg]      Save the option state to a config file
   -r, --load-opts=str        Load options from a config file
                                - disabled as --no-load-opts
                                - may appear multiple times

Options are specified by doubled hyphens and their name or by a single
hyphen and the flag character.

If no 'file'(s) are provided, then standard input is decoded.

The following option preset mechanisms are supported:
 - reading file $HOME/.sharrc

'Uudecode' transforms uuencoded files into their original form.

The encoded file(s) may be specified on the command line, or one may be
read from standard input.  The output file name is specified in the encoded
file, but may be overridden with the '-o' option.  It will have the mode of
the original file, except that setuid and execute bits are not retained.  If
the output file is specified to be '/dev/stdout' or '-', the result will be
written to standard output.  If there are multiple input files and the
second or subsquent file specifies standard output, the decoded data will
be written to the same file as the previous output.  Don't do that.

'uudecode' ignores any leading and trailing lines.  It looks for a line
that starts with "'begin'" and proceeds until the end-of-encoding marker is
found.  The program determines from the header line of the encoded file
which of the two supported encoding schemes was used.
