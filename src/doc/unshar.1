.SH NAME
unshar \- unpack a shar archive
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B unshar
.\" Mixture of short (flag) options and long options
.RB [ \-\fIflag\fP " [\fIvalue\fP]]... [" \-\-\fIopt\-name\fP "[[=| ]\fIvalue\fP]]..." " " "[ file ... ]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Unshar scans the input files (typically email messages) looking for
the start of a shell archive.  If no files are given, then standard
input is processed instead.  It then passes each archive discovered
through an invocation of the shell program to unpack it.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.BR \-d " \fIdir\fP, " \-\-directory "=" \fIdir\fP
change directory to \fIdir\fP first.
.sp
Before unpacking any files, change the current directory to \fIdir\fP.
.TP
.BR \-c ", " \-\-overwrite
Overwrite any pre-existing files.
.sp
This option is passed through as an option to the shar file.  Many
shell archive scripts accept a \fB-c\fP argument to indicate that
existing files should be overwritten.
.TP
.BR \-f ", " \-\-force
This is an alias for the \fI--overwrite\fR option.
.TP
.BR \-E " \fIsplit\-pat\fP, " \-\-split\-at "=" \fIsplit\-pat\fP
separate archives on \fBsplit-pat\fP lines.
.sp
With this option, \fBunshar\fP isolates each different shell archive
from the others which have been placed in the same file, unpacking each
in turn, from the beginning of the file to the end.  Its proper
operation relies on the fact that many shar files are terminated by a
readily identifiable string.
.sp
For example, noticing that most `.signatures' have a double hyphen
("--") on a line right before them, one can then sometimes use
\fB--split-at=--\fP.  The signature will then be skipped, along with
the headers of the following message.
.TP
.BR \-e ", " \-\-exit\-0
split archives at "exit 0" lines.
This option must not appear in combination with any of the following options:
split-at.
.sp
Most shell archives end with a line consisting of simply "exit 0".
This option is equivalent to (and conflicts with)
\fB--split-at="exit 0"\fP.
.TP
.BR \-h , " \-\-help"
Display usage information and exit.
.TP
.BR \-! , " \-\-more-help"
Pass the extended usage information through a pager.
.TP
.BR \-R " [\fIrcfile\fP]," " \-\-save-opts" "[=\fIrcfile\fP]"
Save the option state to \fIrcfile\fP.  The default is the \fIlast\fP
configuration file listed in the \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP section, below.
.TP
.BR \-r " \fIrcfile\fP," " \-\-load-opts" "=\fIrcfile\fP," " \-\-no-load-opts"
Load options from \fIrcfile\fP.
The \fIno-load-opts\fP form will disable the loading
of earlier RC/INI files.  \fI\-\-no-load-opts\fP is handled early,
out of order.
.TP
.BR \-v " [{\fIv|c|n\fP}]," " \-\-version" "[=\fI{v|c|n}\fP]"
Output version of program and exit.  The default mode is `v', a simple
version.  The `c' mode will print copyright information and `n' will
print the full copyright notice.
.SH "OPTION PRESETS"
Any option that is not marked as \fInot presettable\fP may be preset
by loading values from configuration ("RC" or ".INI") file(s).
The file "\fI$HOME/.sharrc\fP" will be used, if present.
.SH "FILES"
See \fBOPTION PRESETS\fP for configuration files.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
One of the following exit values will be returned:
.TP
.BR 0 " (EXIT_SUCCESS)"
Successful program execution.
.TP
.BR 1 " (EXIT_FAILURE)"
The operation failed or the command syntax was not valid.
.TP
.BR 66 " (EX_NOINPUT)"
A specified configuration file could not be loaded.
.TP
.BR 70 " (EX_SOFTWARE)"
libopts had an internal operational error.  Please report
it to autogen-users@lists.sourceforge.net.  Thank you.
